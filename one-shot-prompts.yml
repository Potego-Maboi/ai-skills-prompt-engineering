# One-Shot Prompt Practice
# Code Review Comment
prompt: |
  Write a constructive code review comment for a pull request. Here's an example:
  
  Example: "Great work on implementing the user authentication! I noticed the password validation could be strengthened by adding a check for special characters. Consider using a regex pattern like /^(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])/ to ensure at least one special character. This would align with our security standards. Otherwise, the logic flow looks solid!"
  
  Now write a similar code review comment for a WhatsApp integration module that has good error handling but lacks proper logging.
ai_response: "[Nice work on this implementation! The logic is clear and the structure is easy to follow. A couple of suggestions to consider:
- Error handling: It might be helpful to include a fallback or logging mechanism in case the API call fails. That would improve resilience and help with debugging.
- Variable naming: Consider renaming tempData to something more descriptive (e.g. userSessionData) to clarify its purpose in the context of the method.
- Unit tests: If possible, could you add a couple more test cases for edge scenarios like empty input or unexpected data formats?

# User Story Writing
prompt: |
  Write a user story following this format:
  
  Example: "As a customer service manager, I want to view real-time chat metrics on a dashboard so that I can monitor team performance and identify bottlenecks during peak hours. Acceptance criteria: Dashboard updates every 30 seconds, shows active chats, average response time, and agent availability."
  
  Now write a user story for a customer who wants to receive automated WhatsApp notifications about their order status.

# Bug Report
prompt: |
  Write a detailed bug report using this structure:
  
  Example: "**Title:** Login form validation fails with special characters
  **Environment:** Chrome 120, Windows 11, Production
  **Steps to Reproduce:** 1) Navigate to login page 2) Enter email with + symbol 3) Click submit
  **Expected Result:** User should be logged in successfully
  **Actual Result:** Error message 'Invalid email format' appears
  **Priority:** Medium - affects users with email aliases"
  
  Now write a bug report for WhatsApp messages not being delivered during peak hours.

# Status Update Email
prompt: |
  Write a project status update email following this example:
  
  Example: "Subject: Weekly Update - Mobile App Redesign Project
  
  Hi Team,
  
  Here's our progress update for Week 12:
  
  ‚úÖ **Completed:** User interface mockups for login and dashboard screens
  ‚úÖ **In Progress:** Backend API integration (60% complete)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked:** Waiting for design approval on payment flow
  üìÖ **Next Week:** Complete API integration, begin user testing preparation
  
  Risk: Design approval delay may push testing back 3 days. Mitigation: Parallel work on other screens.
  
  Questions or concerns? Let's discuss in our Friday standup.
  
  Best regards,
  Sarah"
