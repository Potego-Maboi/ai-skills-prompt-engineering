Dear [Stakeholder's Name],
I hope this message finds you well.
As we begin laying the foundation for the new WhatsApp project, I’ve started preliminary work on the requirement analysis. To ensure a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the project’s scope, objectives, and constraints, I’d appreciate your support in clarifying a few key areas.
Specifically, it would be helpful to have more information on:
- Target audience and expected user volume
- Core functionalities and integration points
- Security and compliance requirements
- Any timeline constraints or milestones already in place
Having these details will enable me to conduct a thorough and effective analysis, helping us align closely with business goals and deliver a solution that truly meets stakeholder expectations.
Please let me know a suitable time to connect or feel free to share any documentation you have available.
Looking forward to your feedback.
Best regards,
